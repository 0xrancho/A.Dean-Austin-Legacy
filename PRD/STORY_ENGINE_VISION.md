# Story Engine: Product Vision Document

**Product Name:** Legacy Story Engine
**Archive:** Arthur Dean Austin Digital Archive
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** October 2025

---

## Executive Summary

Legacy archives face a fundamental UX problem: they're optimized for storage, not discovery or storytelling. Users must either know exactly what they're looking for or spend hours browsing. The Story Engine transforms passive document repositories into active narrative experiences through AI-powered story generation.

**Core Innovation:** The "Story Button" - turning natural language queries into narrated multimedia stories with automatic source citation and remixability.

---

## The Problem

### Current State: Digital Filing Cabinets

Most legacy archives are essentially:
- Organized folder structures
- Static documents
- Manual navigation required
- Time-intensive to explore
- No narrative context
- Difficult for non-experts

**Result:** Archives get created once, viewed briefly, then forgotten.

### User Pain Points

**Immediate Family:**
- "I want to understand who Arthur was beyond what I knew"
- "How do I explain his career to my kids?"
- "What should I look at first?"

**Extended Family/Future Generations:**
- Never met him or only knew him briefly
- Don't understand the historical context
- Want the highlights, not everything

**Researchers:**
- Need to quickly assess archive value
- Want specific information fast
- Require proper citations

**Former Colleagues:**
- Looking to verify memories
- Want to find specific projects/events
- May have stories to contribute

---

## The Solution: Story Engine

### Core Concept

**Story-Based Browsing:** Users ask questions or select story templates, and the system generates narrated multimedia presentations from archive documents.

```
User: "Tell me about Dean's professional journey"
[Story Button]
→ 2-minute narrated video
→ Automatic document selection
→ Historical context included
→ Citations provided
→ Downloadable + remixable
```

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** AI generates inaccurate narratives
- **Mitigation:** Human review workflow, confidence scores, source citations always visible

**Risk:** Video generation too slow
- **Mitigation:** Pre-render common stories, progressive delivery, async generation

**Risk:** RAG retrieves wrong documents
- **Mitigation:** Manual curation option, relevance thresholds, user feedback loop

### User Experience Risks

**Risk:** Stories feel impersonal/generic
- **Mitigation:** Customization options, family voice recordings, tone controls

**Risk:** Too complicated for non-technical users
- **Mitigation:** Pre-built templates, onboarding flow, simple defaults

**Risk:** Privacy concerns with public sharing
- **Mitigation:** Granular privacy controls, private/public options, family-only mode

### Content Risks

**Risk:** Limited initial content (only 93 images)
- **Mitigation:** Story engine creates value even with small archives, contribution prompts

**Risk:** Incomplete information
- **Mitigation:** Context from READMEs fills gaps, "what we don't know" transparency
